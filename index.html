    <div>
        <h2>Key</h2>
<p>LOTE- French</p>
<h2>Strengths</h2>

<p>My strengths that I have are, <br>Discoverer, Relating, Achieving. <br>I know that as I have learnt these from life design</p>
<h2>Pillars</h2>
<img src="Pilars.png" alt="Pillars" width="300" height="300">
<h2>Manage</h2>
<h3>-Science</h3>
<p>For Science we use the manage pillar, that pillar is to make sure that<br> we manage our time. </p>
<h3>-LOTE</h3>
<p>For langauages, we are sometimes required to complete Education Perfect<br> tasks. They are usually part of flipped learning but also appear in class.</p>
<h3>-LD</h3>
<p>For most subjects you need to be organised or else you will be forgetting<br> your flipped and stuff.</p>
<h3>-Maths</h3>
<p>In math we do math pathways and every 2 or 3 weeks we do a test. It is our<br> responsibility to complete all modules on time.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Relate</h2>
<h3>LOTE(French)</h3>
<p>I have chosen language for the relate pillar as we use the pillar R4- Communicate<br> effectively. We would obviously use this pillar as we need to talk to learn our language</p>
<h2>Inquire</h2>
<h3>-PDHPE</h3>
<p>For the Inquire pillar I chose the I2 sub pillar, the subject that is associated with<br> this is PDHPE.Research, organise and process information, is what I2 is and we did in-fact do research for<br> PDHPE in the first term.</p>
<h2>Witness</h2>
<h3>-Religion</h3>
<p>Religion is the only subject that is in the witness pillar- the sub pillar is W2 which<br> is,W2 - Display Hope for the future. I can see why religion is in this as we should always have the<br> best hopes in the future. </p>
<h2>Think</h2>
<p>T1 tech, T1 is to critique ideas, and I can see how I have used it as we had to keep<br> changing the code to make sure we don't fail every thing </p>
<h2>Create</h2>
<p>In maths we use C2 which is to apply practice and we do, do stuff in maths like math pathways,etc.<br> Without using C2 math would mean nothing as we can't apply our new understandings.</p>
<h2>Smart Goals</h2>
        <p>S-Specifc-I want to understand the language used in science</p>
        <p>M-Measurable-I could note down the words I have learnt, and by the deadline I should have a explanation to the words</p>
        <p>A-Attainable-Yes,  as I can practice and remember the language</p>
        <p>R-Realistic-Yes, I do belive that it it realistic as I can do it by myself and with support from my teacher</p>
        <p>T-Time Bound-I would like to finish it by end of next term and I would be talking to my teacher for a list of words used and keep it like on my bedroom wall</P>
